#hacket

hacket: a stub of a nethack-inspired game, written in Racket.

## Scope

The aim of this project is to build a framework on which a nethack-like game could be easily written by providing a base platform of map generation for world maps, shops, dungeons, etc.; an automated race- and class-based PC generation system, with manual generation capability; PC and NPC interactions, including hostile and non-hostile action types; a d20 system; and the ability to run the game over a network via telnet or some such other means.

## Why Affero GPL?

The AGPL is an aggressive copyleft license that protects the freedom of code even when an application is delivered across a network. Since this is mainly an academic exercise for me, my intention is that anything anyone learns be available to everybody who wants it.
